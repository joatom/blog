# Review of 2023
2023 is over, time to wrap up some numbers.

I'd like to share with you the numbers of my families energy consumption and $CO_2$ footprint of 2023.
For one reason, it is always interesting to glance at real personal data you usualy don't get to see and I enjoy when I find others' personal numbers on the internet and when I can compare myself to it. Secondly, publishing the data will put some pressure on me to further improve the numbers in 2024.

Our household consists of two adults and three kids.

# Energy consumption
This are the direct consumptions of the household that I could track - like an ESG **Scope 1** measure.

## Electricity

| Consumption in kWh| **2023** |2022 | **<span style="color:green">-</span> / <span style="color:red">+</span>**| 
| -------- |-----|-----|-----|
| Heat pump (hot water & heating) | 1695 | 1919 | <span style="color:green">-224 (12%)</span>\*|
| Household                       | 2625 | 2999 | <span style="color:green">-374 (12%)</span>\*\* |
Both electricity sources are renewable.

\* some of the savings result from reducing the overall room temprature by 2Â°C

\*\* some of the savings result from replacing the old dryer

## Car
| Consumption | **2023** | 2022 | **<span style="color:green">-</span> / <span style="color:red">+</span>**| 
| -------- |-----|----|----|
| Distance in kilometer  | **10047** | 11975 | <span style="color:green">-1928 (16%)</span>|
| Diesel in liter | **673** | 802 | <span style="color:green">-129 (16%)</span>|
| $CO_2$ emissions of Diesel in t | **2.05** | 2.44 | <span style="color:green">-0.39 (16%)</span>|
The average Diesel consumption ranges between 0.065 and 0.067 l/km. The calculations are done with 0.067 l/km.

# Methodology and Data Sources
This section gives some additional information on how I come up with the data.

## Energy consumption
- Electricity: Data is taken from the electricity meters
- Traval distance: Data is taken from car mileage display
- Diesel consumption: Data is taken from car mileage display
- $CO_2$ emissions of Diesel in t: Calculation via @uba_2024

## $CO_2$ footprint
- Emission is calculated via @uba_2024.
- Default values are taken for the categories *General Consumption* and *Public Emissions*.
- Milage for *Carpool* and *Public Transportation* are approximated.
- Categorie *Food* is calculated depending in age and diet.
- Personal emission is either calculated by Houshold emission divided by five (*Housing*, *General Consumption*, *Public Emissions*) or by the actual values (*Transportation*, *Food*).
- German average is taken from @uba_2024.
