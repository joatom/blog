# Website and Blog Comments
The comments are stored by the [utteranc](https://utteranc.es/) github plug-in as issues in my public github repo https://github.com/joatom/blog. The comments are accessable by everybody. If you want me to delete a comment you wrote, please reach out to me and I will remove it as soon as possible.
