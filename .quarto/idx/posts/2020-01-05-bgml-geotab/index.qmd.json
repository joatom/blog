Therefore the notebooks rely as much as possible on BQ. All features are generated in BQ with varying SQL-techniques. The prediction model is also build in BQ.\n\nAdditional resources can be found in my [github repo](https://github.com/joatom/kaggle-2019-BigQuery-Geotab-Intersection-Congestion).\n\n<iframe src=\"https://www.kaggle.com/embed/joatom/bigquery-geotab-bqml?kernelSessionId=24953109\" height=\"800\" style=\"margin: 0 auto; width: 100%; \" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"auto\" title=\"BigQuery-GeoTab [BQML]\"></iframe>\n"},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":true,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","css":["../../styles.css"],"toc":false,"from":"markdown+emoji","output-file":"index.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"quarto-version":"1.2.256","theme":{"light":"flatly","dark":"darkly"},"title-block-banner":true,"layout":"post","comments":{"hypothesis":true},"date":"2020-01-05","description":"My kaggle **1st Place** solution of category 'BigQuery ML Models built in SQL'","categories":["SQL","BigQuery","ML","Competition"],"image":"logo_bqml.png","title":"BigQuery-Geotab Intersection Congestion","author":"Johannes Tomasoni","subtitle":":trophy:"},"extensions":{"book":{"multiFile":true}}}}}
