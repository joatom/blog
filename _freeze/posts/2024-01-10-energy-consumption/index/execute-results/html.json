The assumption is: the more you earn the more you consume. \n- The second biggest block is *Food*. This could be improved by reducing dairy and meat. \n- The third block *Public Emission* covers infrastructure, industry, etc. and is hard to influence on an individual level.\n- The *Housing* category is already quite low because of good insulation and energy efficient heating. \n- The *Transportation* category was low because the five of us share one car. We did few traveling and due to a work from home policy I spend few kilometers commuting.\n\nI firmly believe that the only way to improve life or reduce consumption is by implementing habits into your daily life that are not causing much effort, like enjoying a walk to the bakery instead of squeezing into a car. For bigger changes to work, like installing a PV system, there must be an economic incentive, like a quick armortization and low opportunity costs.\n\n:::{.callout-tip}\n## Life hacks\n- Default to not taking the [car](../2023-01-03-fill-her-up/).\n- Watch out for inefficient electrical devices, like an old dryer. In my case it was much cheaper to replace my broken 15 year old dryer with a new energy efficient one instead of repairing it.\n- Don't just buy things because thy are efficient. Buying a new car every three years is probably not very $CO_2$ efficient, no matter how advanced the battery is.\n- Rule of thumb: Electronics and machines are good for efficiency at work. Outside of work they have lots of downsides: they cost lots of money, the lead to high emissions, they often are noisy, mostly they weaken your body.\n\nThat said, time to switch of my computer and unfold the drying rack, lol. \n\nBye :wink:\n:::\n\n# References\n::: {#refs}\n:::\n\n\n[^1]: The data is taken from the electricity meters.\n[^2]: Data is taken from car mileage display.\n[^3]: $CO_2$ emissions of Diesel is calculated via @uba_2024\n[^4]: Data is taken from car mileage display.\n[^5]: - Default values are taken for the categories *General Consumption* and *Public Emissions*.\n  - Mileage for *Carpool* and *Public Transportation* are approximated.\n  - Category *Food* is calculated depending on age and diet.\n[^6]: Personal emission is either calculated by household emission divided by five (*Housing*, *General Consumption*, *Public Emissions*) or by the actual values (*Transportation*, *Food*).\n[^7]: German average is taken from @uba_2024.\n\n",
