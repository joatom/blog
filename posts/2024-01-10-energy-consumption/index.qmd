# Review of 2023
2023 is over, it's time to crunch some numbers.

I'll share with you the numbers of my families energy consumption and $CO_2$ footprint of 2023.
Our household consists of two adults, three kids and a cat.

In case you know your numbers and are open about it, feel free to share and compare them in the comment section.

# Energy consumption
This are the direct consumptions of the household that I was able to track - like an ESG **Scope 1** measure.

## Electricity

| Consumption in kWh [^1]| **2023** |2022 | **<span style="color:green">-</span> / <span style="color:red">+</span>**| 
| -------- |-----|-----|-----|
| Heat pump (hot water & heating) | 1695 | 1919 | <span style="color:green">-224 (12%)</span>\*|
| Household                       | 2625 | 2999 | <span style="color:green">-374 (12%)</span>\*\* |
Both electricity sources are renewable.

\* main savings result from reducing the overall room temperature by 2Â°C

\*\* some of the savings result from replacing the old dryer

## Car
| Consumption | **2023** | 2022 | **<span style="color:green">-</span> / <span style="color:red">+</span>**| 
| -------- |-----|----|----|
| Distance in kilometer [^2] | **10047** | 11975 | <span style="color:green">-1928 (16%)</span>|
| Diesel in liter | **673** | 802 | <span style="color:green">-129 (16%)</span>|
| $CO_2$ emissions of Diesel in t [^3] | **2.05** | 2.44 | <span style="color:green">-0.39 (16%)</span>|

The average Diesel consumption ranges from 0.065 to 0.067 l/km.[^4] The calculations are done with 0.067 l/km.

# $CO_2$ footprint

The emissions are calculated using @uba_2024, a $CO_2$ calculator provided by the German Government.

## Household emission

| Category | $CO_2$ emission in t [^5]|$CO_2$ emission in t p.P.| Consumption|
|-----|-----|-----|-----|
|*\  \  House*|*\  \  1.45*|*\  \  0.29*||

|*\  \  Electricity*|*\  \  0.07*|*\  \  0.01*|2625 kWh|
|Housing total|1.57|0.31||

|Transportation total|2.62|0.52||
|Food|6.9|1.38| reduced meat, preferred local|
|General Consumption|18.45|3.69| default estimate|
|Public Emissions|5.75|1.15| default estimate|
|**Total**|**35.37**|||
|**Total per person**|| **7.07**||

## Personal emission


```{python}
#|echo: false
#| layout-ncol: 1

import pandas as pd
import seaborn as sns
import seaborn.objects as so
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from seaborn import axes_style

cats = ['Housing','Transportation', 'Food', 'General Consumption', 'Public Emission']
data = pd.DataFrame({'Person':['Me']*5+['German average']*5, 
                     'Category':cats*2,
                     '$CO_2$ Emission in t':[.31,.29,1.67,3.69,1.15,2.49,2.22,1.75,2.73,1.15]}).sort_values(by='$CO_2$ Emission in t',ascending=True)

p=(so.Plot(data, x='Person', y= '$CO_2$ Emission in t', color='Category').add(so.Bar(),so.Agg(), so.Stack()).scale(color='flare')
)
p.label(x="")

```

| Category | $CO_2$ emission in t [^6]| German average [^7]| **<span style="color:green">-</span> / <span style="color:red">+</span>**|

# Conclusion
Options to further reduce my consumption significantly are limited. 

- The biggest contribution is *General Consumption* which is a general estimate depending on our household income. The assumption is: the more you earn the more you consume. 
- The second biggest block is *Food*. This could be improved by reducing dairy and meat. 
- The third block *Public Emission* covers infrastructure, industry, etc. and is hard to influence on an individual level.
- The *Housing* category is already quite low because of good insulation and energy efficient heating. 
- The *Transportation* category was low because the five of us share one car. We did few traveling and due to a work from home policy I spend few kilometers commuting.

I firmly believe that the only way to improve life or reduce consumption is by implementing habits into your daily life that are not causing much effort, like enjoying a walk to the bakery instead of squeezing into a car. For bigger changes to work, like installing a PV system, there must be an economic incentive, like a quick armortization and low opportunity costs.

## Life hacks
- Default to not taking the [car](../2023-01-03-fill-her-up/).
- Watch out for inefficient electrical devices, like an old dryer. In my case it was much cheaper to replace my broken 15 year old dryer with a new energy efficient one instead of repairing it.
- Don't just buy things because thy are efficient. Buying a new car every three years is probably not very $CO_2$ efficient, no matter how advanced the battery is.
- Rule of thumb: Electronics and machines are good for efficiency at work. Outside of work they have lots of downsides: they cost lots of money, the lead to high emissions, they often are noisy, mostly they weaken your body.

That said, time to switch of my computer and unfold the drying rack, lol. 

Bye :wink:
