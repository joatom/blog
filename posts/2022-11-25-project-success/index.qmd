# 1. Focus
<span style="color:lightblue">**[SCOPE]**</span>

The first thing to do, when a project is ready to start, is to define the scope. Depending on the project size and setup this can be done in various granularities. 

In any case, I found it to be very usefull to always make a very high level scope description. An easy way to implement it, is to draw a **Focus Circle** like this:

- Make sure the developers and product owner participate in the Focus Circle creating session.
- Grab a physical sheet of paper. :page_facing_up:
- Draw three circles like a dartboard. :dart:
- Think of your MVP (minimum viable product).
- Now write some of the most important features in the innermost circle. 
- Continue by writing some less important features in the intermediate circle.
- Put some nice-to-have features to the outer circle.
- The feature list must not be complete. The listed features should rather be easy to grasp and be a greate representation of mandatory, important and nice-to-have features.
- Finally, write some out of scope features at the borders of the page.

Now, with the Focus Circle in place, you have a nice tool which can be used through-out the project. Bring it to the first couple of meetings and just pin it to the board or to the wall. 
![](board.png)
Then, after a few meetings, let it disapear. When you are a couple of weeks into your project and tension rises, you disagree on the urgence of topics or the team gets stuck implementing off-topic features, then you take out the Focus Circle, slam it on the desk and remind everybody what the major goal of the project is. I'm sure you'll be back on track, at least for a couple of hours or even days.

# 2. Build a diverse team
<span style="color:green">**[PEOPLE]**</span>

Have you ever been in a team with lots of "alphas"? I once competeted in such team in a workshop against other mixed teams. Guess who did the worst? 
If everyone wants to decide which dinner to cook, it is hard to agree on a recepie. And afterthat somebody still has to cut the onions and peel the potatos.

Another project started out with a team of highly qualified analytically and technically skilled people. The teammates knew eachother well and the hierarchies were clear. One seat still had to be filled for a project governance role. This role was assigned to a person we only had few interactions before. This person had different characteristics than the rest of us and therefore brought different perspectives to the project. Though the person wasn't actually involved in building the product, it was crucial for the project success to have the person in the team.

It's important to sometimes disrupt thinking in established ways, even if this thinking has been successful before. *"We've always done it like this..."* is the tombstone of innovation. Diverse teams will challange this kind of thinking.

# 3. The currency of business
<span style="color:green">**[PEOPLE]**</span>

You think money is the currency of business? Nope. Maybe rank? No. Then it must be a great network? No.

The most valueable currency you can *earn* in business is, when **people want to work with you AGAIN**! Money, rank and network will eventually be the outcome, if people want to work with you again.

What does it take to let people want to work with you again?

1. Trust / Reliability
2. Sympathy / being pleasent
3. Competence / Skill

Oh, you only want to work with highly performing teammates?! There is a trick. Just add a great *Environment* to *Trust*, *Sympathy* and *Competence* and youâ€™ll have a great chance to see high performance happening in your team.


# 4. Do Dailies, Retros & Planning, but smart! 
<span style="color:red">**[PROCESS]**</span>

Just do them! I know, some people hate meetings, especially if the schedule is filled up with meetings. I haven't seen projects fail because of daily meetings, but I have seen projects fail because of the absence of regulare meetings.

But be smart. Daily Meetings don't have to be 15 minutes long. Choose what ever suites the project. Do the recuring meeting always on the same time reduces time wasting coordination. Rather skip one meeting then moving it around in the schedules.

There is also no need for a four hour planning session per sprint where everybody is applying to. The planning can be prepared by few relevant people and fine-tuned lateron in a half-hour session with everybody involved.

Retros? Sure! Hence, no lessons learned, no improvement. No time for emotions, no chacka.

# 5. Train or get help on central issues
<span style="color:lightblue">**[SCOPE]**</span>

- :suspect:: *"I've written html once before in the 90's, I'll design the customers landing page."*
- :cold_sweat:: *Are you kidding?*
- :bowtie:: *"I've organized the best christmas party. Let me draw the BPMN for the main process."*
- :worried:: *Noway!*

We all want to learn, improve and try out new things and it should be part of our job. But it's not a good idea to start with critical steps. There is a reason, why people study and gather experience over time. Do some professional training (many of them are for free) or mix teams with experinced and curious people.

# 6. Use Outsourcing
<span style="color:red">**[PROCESS]**</span>

Remove distractions to keep focused on the project. Deligate duties that are not related to the project to your manager. The manager can manage it.
There is a reason why there is a work in progress limit, it reduces setup time.

![](wip.png)

If there are tasks in your project that nobody is comfortable with, find someone who can do it. For example, your team is all technical, the stakeholders don't understand your language and you also get exhausted following there jargon. Try to recrute somebody to do the communication, there are people who love doing that, your team will shine and you don't get destracted doing your job. 

:hammer:: Delegation, Work in Progress Limits, Recruting

# 7. Keep a Backlog
<span style="color:lightblue">**[SCOPE]**</span>

Its easy to loose track what still has to be done in the future. Gather the tasks that come up, you can still throw them away, if they get useless. Consider to define a proper User Story (*Feature abc, for persona xyz, so that...*), so you don't end up implementing nonsense.

# 8. Prioritize and Reevaluate
<span style="color:lightblue">**[SCOPE]**</span>

Planning is an ongoing process in a project. Priorize important and critical tasks. Keep the big picture in mind (see #1). Reevaluate your priorizations regularly. Don't forget to communicate your decisions. 

# 9. Get regular Feedback
<span style="color:lightblue">**[SCOPE]**</span>

Transparency is your friend. You want a buy-in from all your stakeholders. You might get hints you didn't come up on your own. You also distribute some accountability to the stakeholders. 
Extract tasks from the feedback and put it in the backlog (#7). Reevaluate your priorizations (#8).

# 10. To build Momentum, you have to start small
<span style="color:red">**[PROCESS]**</span>

Imagine, the first project sessions are over and you gathered way to much tasks and feature requests. For sure ther will be more while the project proceeds. You start your first planning session with

- Project duration: 3 Months
- Feature reuqests: 36
- Sprint length: 2 weeks.

At this point it is likely that one of the **Epic-Project-Fails** will gonna happen:

- :suspect:: *We have to built 6 Features per sprint! Which 6 do we pick for sprint 1?*
- :bowtie:: *We have to pick at least 8, because there will come up new tasks along the way!

Now you have to be very strong because your arguments are very counter intuative, if you haven't worked through it and experienced it for many times. So remember your mantras:

1. You want to start your project with an success.
2. Your team is not properly formed yet and is certainly not riding this new project's wave, yet.
3. You havn't thought off every pitfall in advance. E.g. your devops environment might change and onboarding takes longer as expected. 
4. Be aware that humans think linearly not exponantial.

Now, you should strongly insist on picking "only" 1-2 features for the first sprint! In case your team had an outstanding start and everything went smooth, you still can grab an additional task throughout the sprint. Now when you are all set and celebrate the success of the first sprint(s) you can gratually pick more task for the future sprints. 

**You build up momentum.**

![](momentum.png)

Some new task will show up during the project and others will become obselete and disapeare. Stay focused and you will end up with an useful product after the three month. And whatever you end up with is exactly what three month of excelent work is worth it.

# 11. Define Measures for the Goal, not the Spreadsheet
<span style="color:red">**[PROCESS]**</span>

Don't use story points!

If you are a software developer, you are in the creative business. If you do the same things over and over, you'll eventualy end up automating them (e.g. Templates, UnitTest, DevOps-Pipelines, ...).
Hence most of the time you'll end up doing new things.

Very often story points are implicetly defined as a timeslot. So you end up planing timeslots. How do you properly estimate time for work you never did before? Right, very vagualy! You always end up with over or under estimates. But that is not the problem yet.

The problem arises when you link the story points to budgets and personal/team goals.

- Personal/team goals:
    - :woman:: *There are 3 more story points available for the next sprint. Which tasks should we add to the sprint?* 
    - :bowtie:: *Let's squeeze in task xyz, it's three easy story points.*
    - :suspect:: *Mayby task abc is not realy 2 points, but rather 3 points, let's take that one!*

    See, they are fooling themself. Do you have a strict planning process where the story points are not renegotiated, when filling the sprint backlog? So your negotiation happens before, when estimating the story points? Zero-sum. By the way,does anyone still want's to work after 4 hours of "planning"/negitiating?
- Budget:
    - :man:: *Are you sure getting coffee for the team is only 1 story point? Add some buffer and make it 3, I don't want endless discussions with the budgeting team why we are off the plan.*

    Once, again. You fooled yourself, and the budgeting team.

[Gfx. Agile Pyramide]
At this point the agile mind set comes in handy: fixed time, fixed ressources, variable outcome.

- :bowtie:: *You agile folks are so naive. You need a budget to build your product. And you have to make a commitment and promise a certain outcome to get a budget.*
- Naive? 
    - No!
- Need a budged?
    - Yes!
- Make commitment?
    - Yes, we commit to give our blood, sweat and tears for the best possible outcome, given time and money.
- Promise certain outcome
    - We promise best possible outcome, given time and money. To achive this we are constantly reevaluing the project progress using full transparency, prioritizing and reevaluating (#8) and including regular feedback from stakeholders (#9). This mitigates the risk for the person providing the budget.

If you have a healthy relationship and want to increase the currency of business (#3) you are willing to accept. It needs lot's of trust and the risk remains on the site that provides the budget.

What if you can't convince the budget site to agree on an uncertain outcome? One possibility is to use outsourcing (#6). There are many people who love to do communication. And very often there is a way to "spin" things so everybody looks (and sometimes even feels) like a winner. Stay focused on the project and leave politics to those who enjoy it.

Which measures to use instead? Define your measure as complexities rather than timely estimates. Some examples:

- Did we do something like this before? - Yes / No
- Do others do this? - Yes / No
- How clear is the request? - Shallow / cristal clear / to be defined.
- Will the expert be available to answer questions? - Sometimes / instant / on holiday
- etc.


# 12. Always be inclusive
<span style="color:green">**[PEOPLE]**</span>

How does it feel to be left out, when decisions are made that effect your tasks? What happens to the motivation of an expert, when the expert is not invited or ignored on discussion of their field? 

In some case the excluded person feels transactional, they might think:

- :expressionless:: *Allright, I just do my job, don't ask questions and take the money.*

But it can also lead to self-doubt. 

- :confused:: *I get mobbed. - My expertise is not as valuable as I thought. - I'm not making an impact.* 

Or result in a "THEY"-kind of thinking instead of "WE". 

- :unamused:: *They probably didn't want to wast my time. - They try to hold me short. - They are stupid, anyway. - They can do their shit on their own.*

It's clear that exclusion leads to a decline of trust and loss of identifaction with the project.


If you want people to engage, you have to be inclusive.
That doesn't mean, I have to be involved in any decission at any time. But I wan't to have the chance to be involved in topics that are important to me and my work.

But what if you don't want somebody else involved, like in the planning meeting example in #4? The major part of the planning was done by very few people, to be more efficient. But why not add another person to be more inclusive.

Also, be nice to support stuff. a) It's the right thing to do! b) It will come around. (Don't you want the secretary to warn you, if it's *"not a good time to knock on that door to ask for a favor"* and guess who doesn't make it to the email distribution when you behave like a jerk.)



# 13. Let Outsiders join your Meetings
<span style="color:green">**[PEOPLE]**</span>

Considere to open your meetings to people outside of the project. Your company's working culture could improve. You share ideas and might get some usefull feedback from the visitors or insides by visiting others' meetings.

If you fear to be disturbed by the outsiders during the meetings, just set up some rules (e.g. "Visitors shouldn't actively participate. I'll talk about your questions afterwards." ).



# 14. Watch for Breaks and Needs
<span style="color:green">**[PEOPLE]**</span>

If the project really goes well and people are in a flow, the chances are high that people loose track of their health (food, sleep and excerciss) and their social well-beeing (family and friends).

We all love the flow! But be aware that you are running a marathon in a project and you still need power and support when situation in project accure that don't go smoothly. Besides you might put pressure on your mates when you are staying late every day.

If somebody drops out, it puts a hugh burden on the project. You have to restuff, reorganize and eventually find back to the flow. You'll lose focus (#1) in that time.


# 15. Celebrate
<span style="color:red">**[PROCESS]**</span>

If you reach certain milestones, celebrate! Even if the team is tired of the project and everybody is happy that's finally over. At least go out for lunch or dinner with the project mates.

There is nothing more hamsterwheelish than going from one project to the next one without a clear breaking event, such as a celebration. 

It also effects your *currency in business* (see #3). Like the dentist, who gives candy to a kid after a dental session. It makes the kids come back again, with less fear.

Ending an exhausting project with a nice event is a psycholigical trick, too. Looking back, the last impression and feelings are those who stick later on.
